# SAUN.ART

> Proposed solution for Junction 2025 - Sauna Intelligence (main challenge) - Team bltn

Today, companies use sauna-generated data for monitoring-purposes only.

### What if temperature, humidity, proximity, and occupancy can turn into real-time visuals and sound?

Data can become atmosphere. Sauna can feel like a living space.

We are introducing **SAUN.ART**: The first in-sauna screen that shows your sauna state as a unique form of art.

The screen sits in the heat. The art breathes with the people in the room.

A feedback loop between body, heat, and art.

Harvia’s sensors turn hardware into experience.

A sauna is no longer silent. It speaks through motion and sound.
